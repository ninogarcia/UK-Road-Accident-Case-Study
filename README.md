# Case Study - Sales Data Using Python, SQL and Tableau

## Introduction
 The case study involves a Dataset of UK Accidents.

The UK government maintains an exhaustive repository of data on traffic accidents, which is updated annually and made available to the public via the Open Data website. The dataset contains an array of information, ranging from geographic locations to weather conditions, vehicle types, and the number of casualties involved. This comprehensive and fascinating collection of data provides an excellent opportunity for in-depth analysis and research, and the Department of Transport is responsible for publishing it. 

The analysis will follow the 6 phases of the Data Analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, and Act (APPAA).
